Natural Language Processing

This is a basic form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) called Sentiment Analysis in which we will try and classify a movie review as either positive or negative.

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis studies the subjective information in an expression, that is, the opinions, appraisals, emotions, or attitudes towards a topic, person or entity. Expressions can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. For example: “I really like the new design of your website!” → Positive.

## Dataset

This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.
